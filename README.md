## Get started

1. `npm install`: Install package dependencies
2. `npm run dev`: Watch changes in `./src`

## Try it in Figma

Open any project file in the desktop version and go to `Figma > Plugins > Development > Import plugin from manifest...`. Select the `manifest.json` from this directory. You then will be able to test out the plugin.

You only need to do that once. After that you can open it like any other plugin.

## Publish the Changes

1. Go to Figma's Home page
2. Click the profile picture
3. Plugins
4. Scroll down to "In Development". Add the plugin if it isn't already there.
